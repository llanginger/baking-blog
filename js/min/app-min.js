var recipe={title:"The Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies",heroImage:"/images/cookies/selections/hero-cookies.JPG",foreword:"This recipe is a slight modification of that found in The Model Bakery cookbook. This was the first 'proper' baking book I purchased and I've worked my way through almost all of it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a good foundation in real techniques beyond those you'll find on Allrecipes or what have you. The following is the recipe's foreword from the book:<br /><br />These are the chocolate chip cookies of your dreams— that is, if you like them big, chewy, and filled with chips and nuts. Most traditional recipes for this cookie use granulated sugar in addition to the brown sugar, but it’s the brown sugar that supplies the moisture. With all due respect, fans of thin, crisp chocolate chip cookies should look elsewhere.",ingredients:["2 cups/ 290 g unbleached all-purpose flour","3/4 tsp baking soda","1/ 2 tsp fine sea salt","3/4 cup plus 1 Tbsp/ 185 g unsalted butter, at room temperature","1 1/3 cups/ 275 g packed light brown sugar","2 large eggs, at room temperature","1 tsp pure vanilla extract","550 g chocolate chips"],steps:[{head:"1.

Makin' The Dough",instructions:"Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer set on medium speed, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until light in color, about 11/ 2 minutes. (Or cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with a wooden spoon until light in color, about 5 minutes.) Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture in thirds, mixing just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts.
